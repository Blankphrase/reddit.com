and bayonet, you 
might be inclined to say, &ldquo;What a badass weapon!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But when it comes to badassery among firearms, there is a pyramid, and 
near the peak is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAU-8_Avenger" target="Fourmilab_GAU8_Aux">GAU-8 Avenger</a>.
Let&rsquo;s look at some of the details 
of this bad boy.
</p>

<p>
Well, first of all, it&rsquo;s <em>big</em>&mdash;cast your eye at the picture above 
comparing it to a Volkswagen beetle. What you see is the gun itself, at 
the left, which is 2.85 metres long, attached to the ammunition feed 
assembly (together, they are called the A/A 49E-6 Gun System), which 
brings the total length to 6 metres. The barrels are 2.3 metres in 
length, chambered for the 30&times;173&nbsp;mm cannon round. Total weight, without 
ammunition, is 281 kg; fully loaded the gun and ammunition weigh around 
1800 kg. This is not your weapon of choice for concealed carry.
</p>

<p>
The design is based upon that of the 19th century
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_gun" target="Fourmilab_GAU8_Aux">Gatling gun</a>.
There 
are seven barrels mounted around the periphery of a cylinder. While the 
original Gatling gun was hand cranked, the GAU-8&rsquo;s barrel cylinder is 
rotated by two hydraulic motors. Although it is a repeating weapon, it 
is not an automatic weapon in the usual sense. As the cylinder rotates, 
each barrel is loaded, fired, unloaded, and reloaded in sequence by a 
system of cams. The recoil and gas from rounds fired plays no part in 
the operation of the gun. (This means that a misfire does not affect 
the firing of subsequent rounds.)

<p>
The gun is chambered for the 30&times;173&nbsp;mm round. There are three versions 
of this round: an armour piercing incendiary with a projectile 
consisting of an aluminium jacket and a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depleted_uranium" target="Fourmilab_GAU8_Aux">depleted uranium</a>
penetrator, 
and a high explosive incendiary. A combat load usually consists of a 
belt with five of the armour piercing rounds to one high explosive. An 
inexpensive target practice round is also available. If you&rsquo;re in the 
market, here is the
<a href="https://www.orbitalatk.com/defense-systems/armament-systems/30mm/docs/GAU-8A_Fact_Sheet.pdf" target="Fourmilab_GAU8_Aux">data sheet</a>.
The ammunition uses a lightweight 
aluminium cartridge case instead of the usual brass or steel. This 
allows aircraft to carry more rounds.
</p>

<p>
Ballistic performance of the three kinds of ammunition is almost 
identical. The muzzle velocity of the armour piercing incendiary round 
(PGU-14 API) is 1013 metres/second, with a projectile mass of 395 
grams. This gives a muzzle energy of around 203,000 joules. This is on 
the order of ten times the energy of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.50_BMG" target="Fourmilab_GAU8_Aux">.50 BMG</a>
round, which is 
generally considered rather badass, and more than a hundred times that 
of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.56%C3%9745mm_NATO" target="Fourmilab_GAU8_Aux">5.56&times;45&nbsp;mm</a>
cartridge fired by the M-16 and its variants. If one 
of these is coming your way, hiding behind a car won&rsquo;t save you. 
Neither will hiding behind a <em>tank</em>.
</p>

<p>
But the whole point of the GAU-8 is that there&rsquo;s never just one round 
coming your way. As each barrel rotates to the 9 o&rsquo;clock position as 
seen from the front (Pro Tip: don&rsquo;t observe it from there), it fires, 
and rounds are discharged as rapidly as the barrel cylinder spins. When 
the trigger is initially pulled and the barrel spins up, it fires about 
50 rounds in the first second, then 65 rounds per second thereafter. 
The sustained rate of fire is 3900 rounds per minute, or 65 rounds per 
second. It does not sound like a machine gun: the rate of fire is so 
rapid it&rsquo;s more like <em>brrrrrrrp</em>!
</p>

<p>
The gun is usually fired in one or two second bursts, but there&rsquo;s no 
reason the entire ammunition load of 1150 rounds couldn&rsquo;t be expended 
in a single mad 18 second burst. Anybody who did this would probably 
have some &rsquo;splainin&rsquo; to do and lots of forms to fill out, as it would 
reduce barrel life.
</p>

<p>
Accuracy is specified as 80% of rounds falling within a cone five 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_mil" target="Fourmilab_GAU8_Aux">milliradians</a>
from the point of aim. At a range of 1200 metres, 80% of 
rounds will hit within a 12 metre diameter circle.

<p>
The GAU-8 is carried by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Republic_A-10_Thunderbolt_II"
    target="Fourmilab_GAU8_Aux">A-10 Thunderbolt II</a>
close air support 
aircraft, better known by its nickname, &ldquo;Warthog&rdquo;. Well, not so much 
carried: it&rsquo;s more accurate to say that the A-10 was built around the 
gun. The gun accounts of 16% of the plane&rsquo;s weight; when it&rsquo;s removed, 
the plane has to be mounted on a jack stand to keep it from tipping 
back on its tail. The gun is installed offset to the right as viewed 
from the front (again, <em>don&rsquo;t stand there</em>) so that the firing barrel 
will be aligned with the centre line of the plane as it fires. This is 
important: the recoil from a GAU-8 firing full-tilt is greater than the 
thrust of one the plane&rsquo;s two engines, and if it were offset from the 
centre of mass, firing the gun would cause the plane to veer off 
course. When the gun fires, the oxygen-free combustion products from 
the ammunition may be ingested into the plane&rsquo;s engines, causing them 
to flame out. The engine igniters are automatically activated whenever 
the gun is firing to prevent this. Spent cartridge cases are not 
ejected overboard; this would shift the centre of gravity of the plane 
and possibly render it uncontrollable, as well as pose a hazard to any 
plane flying nearby or below. Instead, they are captured and retained 
in the ammunition magazine, then unloaded at the end of the mission.
</p>

<p>
The A-10 is the only aircraft to use the GAU-8. It was designed into 
the Dutch
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_CIWS" target="Fourmilab_GAU8_Aux">Goalkeeper CIWS</a>
(Close-In Weapon System) shipboard defense 
system, which is deployed by the navies of eight countries. Naturally, 
one wonders about other applications.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe" target="Fourmilab_GAU8_Aux">Randall Munroe</a>
has calculated 
that if you mounted a GAU-8 on a compact car, pointed aft, and fired 
it, you could accelerate to the speed limit in less than three seconds. 
There is a
<a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/21/jetpack_speeding.png" target="Fourmilab_GAU8_Aux">delightful cartoon</a>,
which I can&rsquo;t reproduce here for reasons 
of copyright, in the

This may not be such a 
great idea, but it&rsquo;s cool; where are the
